# üìÇ JS Mini projects

## üß† Overview
This directory contains a collection of small JavaScript projects created to sharpen my programming skills, deepen my understanding of UI/UX design, and improve my ability to prompt and interact with AI-powered interfaces. Each project is designed to be self-contained, focusing on a specific concept or technique. Through building these projects, I have explored practical aspects of web development, experimented with new ideas, and enhanced my portfolio.

## üìò Key Concepts
- Vanilla JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Responsive UI/UX design
- AI-powered enhancements and prompt engineering
- Modular coding practices
- Interactive web components

## üìÑ File Documentation

### `file1.ext`
- **Purpose:** [Brief description of what this file does]
- **Key Features:** [List main features or techniques used]
- **Learning Outcome:** In this project, I practiced the basics of JavaScript syntax and logic, focusing on how to structure code for clarity and maintainability. I also experimented with simple DOM manipulation, which helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.

### `file2.ext`
- **Purpose:** [Brief description of what this file does]
- **Key Features:** [List main features or techniques used]
- **Learning Outcome:** This project allowed me to dive deeper into event handling and responsive design. I learned how to create interactive components that respond to user input, and I explored techniques for making layouts adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, I started integrating AI-powered features, which improved my skills in prompt engineering and user experience design.
