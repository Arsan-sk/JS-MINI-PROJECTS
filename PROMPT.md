## Prompt
You are given a JavaScript-based project that currently contains only plain HTML without CSS. Your task is to enhance the project’s UI/UX by creating a professional, modern, and user-friendly design.

Instructions:

Understand the Project Context

Carefully analyze the existing index.html (or equivalent entry file) to understand the structure, purpose, and flow of the project.

Identify the project type (e.g., quiz app, portfolio, chatbot, dashboard, etc.).

Design Theme & Styling

Based on the project type, suggest 3–5 trending design themes (e.g., minimalistic, neumorphism, glassmorphism, retro UI, cyberpunk, material design).

Select the most suitable theme and apply it consistently across the project.

CSS Implementation

Create an external stylesheet named style.css and link it to the project.

Use modern design principles with:

Smooth transitions & hover animations.

Interactive button effects.

Responsive layouts for desktop & mobile.

Readable typography and appropriate color palette.

Optionally, integrate Tailwind CSS or other frameworks for faster styling.

UI Enhancements

Add icons (via Font Awesome, Lucide, Heroicons, etc.) where appropriate.

Use high-quality images, SVGs, or illustrations (from Unsplash, Pexels, or free libraries) if it improves user experience.

Introduce subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, slide, scale effects) for elements where needed.

Extra Features for Attractiveness

Add a navigation bar, footer, or side panel if the structure demands it.

Ensure the design feels unique, trendy, and visually appealing.

Maintain balance: attractive but not cluttered.

Output

Provide a CSS styling plan/outline first (colors, fonts, layouts, animations).

Then implement the complete style.css file (or Tailwind config if used).

Suggest any additional external libraries required.
